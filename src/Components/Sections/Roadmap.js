    <h3>A New World</h3>
    <p>
    At the horizon dense degraded circuitry under gradient
    twilight lights glimpse into a world where shadow
    obstructs and clutters with uneven machinery the
    metropolises' skylines.
                                                  </p>
    <p>
    They call them <strong>Mechas</strong>, and they're
    programmed to watch over the citizens' peace and prosperity.
                                                 </p>
    <p>
    But through the <strong>Rebels</strong>' uncorrupted eye we see
    mechanisms rotten to the core rule on every street, school,
    park, nightclub, rest home, motel room and gambling den in town.
                                                    </p>
    <p>
    As the night lurks in the <strong>Underground</strong> awakes,
    and a thousand windows, cars, motherboards, air conditioners
    and neon signs light up all at the same time.
                                            </p>
    <p>
    It's the birth of <b>a new era</b>, are you just going to watch?

    <h3>Long and Winding Road</h3>
    <p>
    That's what we plan to go through, with all of you.
                                                  </p>
    <p>
    And through all the universes that are about to
    spawn—through the generation that will state once and for
    all what identity is and how we can define it—we are going
    to stick through whatever turning point in the long and
    winding road ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
    And as messy as that is, we will try our best to get the
    way down clear and linear for you to travel upon.
                                     </p>
    <p>
    That's why we believe in <b>minimalism</b>. Whenever we provide
    you with information, software, interfaces, we try to keep
    it as simple and stupid as possible—so the important stuff
    is always in clear sight.

    <h3>The End of an Era</h3>
    <p>
    Our world used to be one of a kind. A distinctive mark
    in an otherwise unholy chaos of wishful thinking and
    abstract themes. Now, we have to adapt.
</p>
    <p>
    We have to take what we can and discriminate the rest.
                                          </p>
    <p>
    Our choices <i>pave</i> the way before us.
                                         </p>
    <p>
    Change doesn't happen overnight, but one <b>giant step</b>
    each day.
            </p>
    <p>
    The line that separates us from our dreams becomes thinner
    at exponentially growing paces.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's the <b>end of an era</b>, but
    the beginning of a different one.
