    <h3>A New World</h3>
    <p>
    At the <strong>Horizon Centre</strong> dense degraded
    circuitry under the gradient twilight stars glimpsed into a
    world where shadow obstructs and clutters with uneven
    machinery the metropolises' skyline.
                                                  </p>

    They call them <strong>Mechas</strong>, and they're
    programmed to watch over the citizens' peace and prosperity.
                                                 </p>
    <p>
    But through the <strong>Rebels</strong>' uncorrupted eye we see
    mechanisms rotten to the core that rule on every street,
    merry-go-round, brothel, strip show, motel room and gambling den
    in town.
           </p>
    <p>
    As the night lurks in the <strong>Underground</strong> awakes,
    and a thousand windows, <strong>Phantoms</strong>, motherboards
    and neon signs light up all at the same time.
                                            </p>

    It's the birth of <b>a new era</b>, are you just going to watch?

    <h3>A Digital Realm</h3>
    <p>
    In this evolving digital realm, new and varied worlds
    spawn on everyday basis. With so many people coming and going
    it's hard to keep a steady eye on things.  That's why this project
    is so important to us. <b>We will
    not let our values drift and we will keep our goals on top
    of priorities at all times.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Because we all need something
    to believe in.
    </p>
    <p>
    The next generation is coming and it will state once and for
    all what identity is and how it is defined. And as messy as
    that is, we will try our best to get the path down in a clear
    and linear way for you to travel upon.
