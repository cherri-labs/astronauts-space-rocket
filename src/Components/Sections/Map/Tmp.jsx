{" "}is a type of virtual world which allows
users to interact and influence each other in a shared virtual
environment. This immersive experience seeks to replicate the
dystopian slate of science fiction stories, creating an open-ended
experience for users within which they can explore multiple
storylines and outcomes. Interactivity between different denizens
of the metaverse results in an emergent narrative as participants
engage with each other through gameplay or programmed elements,
allowing for persistent individual and collective stories.
