    <h3>A New World</h3>
    <p>
    A new world is emerging from the soil of dense integrated
    circuits and gradient skies of composite layer. We are
    approaching a limit where the view inside our own
    cybernetic space will be obstructed and cluttered with
    skyline horizons of targeted advertisement and uneven
    machinery.
                                                  </p>
    <p>
    Our world used to be one of a kind. A distinctive mark
    in an otherwise unholy chaos of wishful thinking and
    abstract schemes of thought. Now we have to adapt,
    leaving space to the offchance we are not alone in this.
                                                  </p>
    <p>
    Our universe does not travel in a straight line. At each
    turning point, our choices <i>pave</i> the way before us.
                                                        But it's not just one path; in fact, it's all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a theory that states how all possible choices
    and events are concomitant to the <i>real world</i>.
                                                  </p>
    <p>
    The destination clear less and less, and yet, it appears
    as though we know where we go with our every movement,
    even though we can't gauge the dimension of it.
                                                        </p>
    <p>
    For this reason we don't rush things to go anywhere.
                                                   For change doesn't happen overnight, but one tiny step
    each day. We're not afraid to take bold gestures, and we're
    not afraid to take a small step back. We believe in what we
    do, that's why we put our heart and soul into it.

    <h3>Long and Winding Road</h3>
    <p>
    That's what we plan to go through, with all of you.
                                                  </p>
    <p>
    And through all the universes that are about to
    spawn—through the generation that will state once and for
    all what identity is and how we can define it—we are going
    to stick through whatever turning point in the long and
    winding road ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
    And as messy as that is, we will try our best to get the
    way down clear and linear for you to travel upon.
                                     </p>
    <p>
    That's why we believe in <b>minimalism</b>. Whenever we provide
    you with information, software, interfaces, we try to keep
    it as simple and stupid as possible—so the important stuff
    is always in clear sight.
